# dotfiles
files with a dot at the beginning for eric

## bashrc
would caution against drag-and-drop replacement of the default `.bashrc`
but you should be able to add the snippet that sources everything in `.bashrc.d`

## tmux
clone tpm and symlink the contents of `tmux/` to `.config/tmux/`
should be able to just run `tmux/setup-tmux.sh`
